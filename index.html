	Spatial Statistics is a sub-field of Statistics that focusses on development of statistical methodology 
		suitable for analyzing spatial or spatio-temporal data. It requires modeling of dependency by spatial and/or temporal information. 
		<br>
						
	Spatial data are observations that come with location information. A typical example is PM2.5 measurements at monitoring stations.
        When the data are observed temporally as well, they are called spatio-temporal data.<br><br>
